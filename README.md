# Introduction 
Paget's disease is a chronic bone disorder that disrupts the normal bone remodeling process, leading to enlarged and misshapen bones. It often affects the pelvis, spine, skull, and legs, including the tibia (shinbone).
In my recent project focusing on Paget's disease for bone fracture detection, I employed an advanced approach to analyze MRI images. I began by patchifying a high-resolution MRI image of 12K by 12K pixels into over 100 smaller segments to create a robust dataset. Utilizing various U-Net models, including those based on ResNet architectures, I trained the machine learning algorithms to identify and label anomalies as mask within these images. This involved working with image sequences to enhance model accuracy and performance. To facilitate further research and evaluation, I shared the Python code used in this project, allowing other researchers to apply and test the U-Net models on their own datasets. This collaborative approach aims to advance the detection capabilities for Paget’s disease and similar conditions.
